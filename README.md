# Bengali-Text-To-Image
For Major Project of MCA 2024.
We have trained a transformer to translate bengali texts to english which uses the sentencepiece tokenizer.
When you compile the code with a dataset,the vocab and tokenizers will be generated automatically.
This transformer generates english captions that are fed to a Stable Diffusion pretrained pipeline for now. 
That gets us generated images.
